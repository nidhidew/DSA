# Sliding Window
* Sliding window is a technique use to reduce the time complexity of certain problems involving arrays or strings, especially when you're working with contiguous subarrays or substrings.

* When to use it?
- Find the maximum/minimum/average/sum of subarrays or substrings.

- Work with fixed-size or variable-size windows (subarrays).

- Optimize a brute-force nested loop solution.

* Types of Sliding Windows

| Type                     | Use Case                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fixed-size window**    | You know the window size (e.g., size `k`)                               |
| **Variable-size window** | You don't know the window size; based on condition (e.g., sum â‰¤ target) |
