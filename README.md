### Tips to solve dsa problems
* read the question as long as, you get the notes or hints by yourself.
* then create a algorithm, try to execute that algo in the notebook
* if in the notebook answer is coming then try coding in system first if requirement is satisfied then run that code in leetcode.
* try to read **HINTS** 
* if in leetcode output is false then do the 1st step again. re-read the question,modify or create a new algo,try in notebook first,then run again in system then leetcode.
* if its succesfully run then let it be and push the code, if still error is coming then use chatgpt to modify the algorithm not code.
